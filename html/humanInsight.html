            <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
            <p>This project was during my internship at Basic Orange. They got a design challenge from Human Insight. Human Insight is a company that takes assessments by employees from another company to discover how teamwork is in the company. They help them to optimize the teamwork in the company. Human Insight wanted to update their admin website because it didn’t represent who they are anymore. </p>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Human Insight had just updated their general website but they didn’t update their admin website. So my task was to give it a modern look and feel. I have used their new website as a base for their new admin website so everything was consistent.</p>

            <h3>Internal website</h3>
            <p>Their internal website had to function the same as their current website. We have changed the design of the website to a modern look and we have added a customizable dashboard that shows an overview of all the data. </p>

            <h3>AEM-Cube</h3>
            <p>The AEM-Cube shows the assessment results in a 3D graph. I have redesigned the graph so it was easier to read them. I have added guides on the axes of the cube and the ground has a grid. The axes have a shadow so it’s easier to see that the graph is a cube. The pillars have a figure on top of it to indicate what category it is representing. </p>

            <h3>AEM-Cube Questionnaire</h3>
            <p>The questionnaire has a simple and clean interface so the user can focus on the questions. We have hidden the navigation on the top of the page to archive this look. The idea was to make it look like an app. The user can find the navigation by scrolling up. On the top of the page, there is an indication bar that shows the progress. </p>
