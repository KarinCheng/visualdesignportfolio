            <h3>Design Challenge</h3>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Global pollution is a big problem where a lot of different aspects play a role. So we focus on local seasonal fruits and vegetables. Our target group has to be more aware of their choices and it can inspire the wrongdoers to do the same.</p>
